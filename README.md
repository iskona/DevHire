### User Story

As a freelance developer
I need to find work and advertise myself
So that I can get jobs efficiently and built my portfolio in one place

As an employer
I need to find developers based on criteria
So that I can have the work done effectively

### Goals
- Work together as a group
- Create a working website for businesses and freelance developers to connect on
- Work through the difficulties of a shared project with more parts and intricacies

## Overview

For Project 2, we were asked to work together to solve real world problems using everything we have learned up to this point. What we created is a site with 2 ends, one for employers and one for freelance developers, to connect and work.
From the employer side, this means setting up an account, creating projects, browsing developers, and assigning the project.
From the developer side, this means setting up an account with a link to portfolio, being notified of assigned projects and either accepting or rejecting them, and then marking projects as complete when finished.
The general flow starts when a project is created by a client, who will then browse freelancers and assign the project to one of these developers based on skills and criteria. This project will then appear in the "New Project Offers" section of that developers project page, at which point he will either reject it, sending it back to be re-assigned by the client, or accept, moving the project to their "Ongoing Projects" section. Once they finish the work required, they will click the "Mark it as Done" button and it will be sent to the "Completed Projects" section of their project section as well as that of the client.
